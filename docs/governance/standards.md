# Governance Protocol: The Kingston 150 Standard 🛡️

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** Dec 29, 2025
**Scope:** All services listed in the HelpBridge database.

---

## 1. The "Do No Harm" Mandate

We prioritize **accuracy over coverage**. It is better to return _no result_ than to send a vulnerable user to a closed door, a disconnected phone line, or an unsafe environment.

### 1.1 The "Do-Not-Log" List

To protect user privacy, the following intent categories triggers a **Zero-Log Policy**. No query text, IP address, or metadata is recorded for these searches:

- Suicide / Self-Harm
- Sexual Violence / Assault
- Domestic Violence
- Substance Use / Overdose

## Data Standards & Verification Levels (L-Scale)

Every service in the database must be assigned a verification level.

| Level  | Definition                                                                                                        | Display Policy             |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **L0** | **Unverified.** Raw data scraped from web or submitted by public.                                                 | **HIDDEN**                 |
| **L1** | **Existence Verified.** Phone number calls through, Website loads. Confirmed active within 90 days.               | ✅ **VISIBLE**             |
| **L2** | **Eligibility Verified.** Inclusion/Exclusion criteria verified against official documentation (PDF, About Page). | ✅ **VISIBLE**             |
| **L3** | **Provider Confirmed.** Direct contact (email/phone) with service provider confirming details.                    | ✅ **VISIBLE** (Preferred) |
| **L4** | **Official Partner.** Signed MOU or Data Sharing Agreement.                                                       | 🌟 **FEATURED**            |

> **Current Pilot Standard:** All visible services must be **L1 or higher**.

## 3. Identity & Equity Attributes

We do not apply "vibes-based" tagging. All identity tags must be **Evidence-Based**.

### 3.1 Affirming Care Standards

To tag a service as `2SLGBTQI+ Friendly` or `Indigenous-Led`, the record must include an `evidence_url` pointing to a public statement by the organization.

- **Acceptable Evidence:** "About Us" page stating mandate, Board of Directors list, official mandate.
- **Unacceptable Evidence:** Third-party directories, assumptions based on name/logo.

---

## 4. Maintenance Cycle

- **Crisis Services:** Verified Monthly.
- **General Services:** Verified Quarterly.
- **Stale Data:** Any record not verified in > 6 months is auto-downgraded to **L0** (Hidden).
